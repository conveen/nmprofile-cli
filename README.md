# nmprofile: Executable Network Profiles via NetworkManager CLI.

## Overview

`nmprofile` is a command line framework for creating executable network profiles via the NetworkManager CLI on [pop\_os!](https://pop.system76.com/).
All crate documentation is available at (https://conveen.github.io/nmprofile-cli).

## Recommended Usage

To use this crate/framework, fork this repo to your own GitHub account or other source control platform.
This will allow you to create your own profiles and commit them to your copy of the repo. If you'd like to hack on the core framework itself,
I'd recommend creating a separate branch with your custom profiles to make submitting PRs upstream easier.

## Contributing

Contribution are welcome! Before submitting a PR, please ensure the code compiles, that you've written some description of what the PR is meant to accomplish,
and that you've updated the in-code documentation appropriately. PR reviews may be infrequent, but I'll do my best.
